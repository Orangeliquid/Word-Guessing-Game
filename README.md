# Word Guessing Game

## Overview
This is a simple Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player needs to guess the word by inputting one character at a time. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and allows the player to quit at any time.

## Instructions
1. Run the script main.py using a Python interpreter.
2. The game will randomly select a word from the predefined list.
3. Guess the word by entering one character at a time.
4. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
5. To quit the game, type "quit."

## Customization
Feel free to customize the game by adding words to the `word_list` or pulling words from an external file (e.g., words.txt). You can enhance the game by expanding the word list for a more diverse gaming experience.

## Dependencies
The game relies on the built-in random module in Python and does not require any additional dependencies.
